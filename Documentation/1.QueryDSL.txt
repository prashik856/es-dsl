Query DSL

Leaf query clauses
Leaf query clauses look for a particular value in a particular field, such as the match, term or range queries. These queries can be used by themselves.

Compound Query Clauses:
Compound query clauses wrap other leaf or compound queries and are used to combine multiple queries in a logical 
fashion (such as the bool or dis_max query), or to alter their behaviour (such as the constant_score query).

"query" context or "filter" context.


Allow Expensive Queries:
What the type of queries that are expensive?
1. Queries that need to do linear scans to identify matches:
Example: 
script queries:
Look at 2.ScriptQueries.txt file.

2. Queries that have a high up-front cost:
fuzzy queries 
regexp queries 
prefix queries 
wildcard queries 
range queries on text and keyword values  -> That means we should run range queries on int or double type fields.

3. Joining Queries 

4. Queries on deprecated geo shapes.

5. Queries that may have a high per-document cost:
script_scores queries 
percolate queries
