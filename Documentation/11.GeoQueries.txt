Geo Queries 
Elasticsearch supports two types of geo data: geo_point fields which support lat/lon pairs, 
and geo_shape fields, which support points, lines, circles, polygons, multi-polygons, etc.

The queries in this group are:

geo_bounding_box query: Finds documents with geopoints that fall into the specified rectangle.


geo_distance query: Finds documents with geopoints within the specified distance of a central point.


geo_polygon query: Find documents with geopoints within the specified polygon.


geo_shape query: 
    Finds documents with:
        Geoshapes which either intersect, are contained by, or do not intersect with the specified geoshape
        Geopoints which intersect the specified geoshape
