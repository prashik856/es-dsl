SCRIPT QUERIES

Example of Script queries?
Filters documents based on a provided script. The script query is typically used in a filter context.
GET /_search
{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "filter": {
        "script": {
          "script": """
            double amount = doc['amount'].value;
            if (doc['type'].value == 'expense') {
              amount *= -1;
            }
            return amount < 10;
          """
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
-> We give a query, which uses bool inside.
Inside bool, we remember we can use must, must_not, filter, etc.
here, we are using filter.
Inside the filter, we want to find the particular script.
That script is given inside "script" context.
Inside the "script" context, we provide the actual script that we want to search.

We can also use runtime queries to get the same result:
GET /_search
{
  "runtime_mappings": {
    "amount.signed": {
      "type": "double",
      "script": """
        double amount = doc['amount'].value;
        if (doc['type'].value == 'expense') {
          amount *= -1;
        }
        emit(amount);
      """
    }
  },
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "filter": {
        "range": {
          "amount.signed": { "lt": 10 }
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "fields": [{"field": "amount.signed"}]
}
What do we have here?
We know our query, right?
We are using bool context, and a filter context inside it.
In the filter context, we want to find all the documents with "range" context
We want to find all documents where the value of field "amount.signed" is less than 10.

I am looking at the "runtime_mappings" the first time?
We have "runtime_mappings" context, where we are mapping the field "amount.signed".
We are setting it's type to double.
Then, we also have a script filed wholse value is defined by us?

At the end, we have "fields" context, an array, 
where we can provide various field values.
here, we are giving the field value as "amound.signed". (look for a document with a field "amount.signed" in it.)

Scripts are cached for faster execution.
GET /_search
{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "filter": {
        "script": {
          "script": {
            "source": "doc['num1'].value > params.param1",
            "lang": "painless",
            "params": {
              "param1": 5
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
