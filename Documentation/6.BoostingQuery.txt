Boosting Query:
Returns documents matching a positive query while reducing the relevance score of documents that also match a negative query.

You can use the boosting query to demote certain documents without excluding them from the search results.

        "term": {
          "text": "apple"
        }

        "term": {
          "text": "pie tart fruit crumble tree"

Top Level parameter for boosting query:
positive:
Query you wish to run. Any returned documents must match this query.
"positive" clause contains the query which we need to run (here, we have a "term" query.)

negative:
Query used to decrease the relevance score of matching documents.
Similaryly, we have a "negative" clause which requires a query inside them.

If a returned document matches the positive query and this query, the boosting query calculates the final relevance score for the document as follows:
Take the original relevance score from the positive query.
Multiply the score by the negative_boost value.

negative_boost:
 Floating point number between 0 and 1.0 used to decrease the relevance scores of documents matching the negative query.
