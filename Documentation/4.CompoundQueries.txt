COMPOUND QUERIES:
Compound queries wrap other compound or leaf queries, either to combine their results and scores, 
to change their behaviour, or to switch from query to filter context.

1. "bool" query 
The default query for combining multiple leaf or compound query clauses
as "must", "should", "must_not", or "filter" clauses
The "must" and "should" clauses have their scores combined — the more matching clauses, the better
while the "must_not" and "filter" clauses are executed in filter context. -> No scores. 

2. "boosting" query 
Return documents which match a positive query, but reduce the score of documents which also match a negative query.

3. constant_score query 
A query which wraps another query, but executes it in filter context. All matching documents are given the same “constant” _score.

4. dis_max query 
A query which accepts multiple queries, and returns any documents which match any of the query clauses. 
While the bool query combines the scores from all matching queries, the dis_max query uses the score of the single best- matching query clause.

5. function_score query 
Modify the scores returned by the main query with functions to take into account factors like popularity, 
recency, distance, or custom algorithms implemented with scripting.
