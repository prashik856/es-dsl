Intervals Query

Returns documents based on the order and proximity of matching terms.

The intervals query uses matching rules, constructed from a small set of definitions. These rules are then applied to terms from a specified field.

Example Request:
The following "intervals" search returns documents containing "my
favorite food" without any gap, followed by "hot water" or "cold porridge" in the "my_text" field.

This search would match a "my_text" value of "my favorite food is cold
porridge" but not "when it's cold my favorite food is porridge".
POST _search

  "query": {
    "intervals" : {
      "my_text" : {
        "all_of" : {
          "ordered" : true,
          "intervals" : [
            {
              "match" : {
                "query" : "my favorite food",
                "max_gaps" : 0,
                "ordered" : true
              }
            },
            {
              "any_of" : {
                "intervals" : [
                  { "match" : { "query" : "hot water" } },
                  { "match" : { "query" : "cold porridge" } }
                ]
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
Here, we have intervals query.
then we go search inside "my_text" field.
Then, we have "all_of" clause, which signifies we are searching in the whole value of "my_text" field.

ordered -> true -> that means the intervals and their matchings should be in order.
We then define array of intervals, where run our queries.
Here, we define one match query and, where we search for a query , "my favorite food" without any gaps.
Then we have another interval defined.
This interval is of type, any_of, and then again we have set of intervals:
They have a match query query which match either hot water or cold porridge.

Top Level parameters of intervals:
"<FIELD>":
Field you wish to search.

Valid rules include:
- match
- prefix
- wildcard
- fuzzy
- all_of
- any_of


Match Rules Parameters:
The match rule matches analyzed text.
query : (Required, string) Text you wish to find in the provided <field>.

max_gaps: (Optional, integer) Maximum number of positions between the matching terms. Terms further apart than this are not considered matches. Defaults to -1.
If unspecified or set to -1, there is no width restriction on the match. If set to 0, the terms must appear next to each other.

ordered: (Optional, Boolean) If true, matching terms must appear in their specified order. Defaults to false.

analyzer: (Optional, string) analyzer used to analyze terms in the query. Defaults to the top-level <field>'s analyzer.

filter : (Optional, interval filter rule object) An optional interval filter.

use_field: 
(Optional, string) If specified, then match intervals from this field rather than the top-level <field>. 
Terms are analyzed using the search analyzer from this field. 
This allows you to search across multiple fields as if they were all the same field; 
for example, you could index the same text into stemmed and unstemmed fields, and search for stemmed tokens near unstemmed ones.
