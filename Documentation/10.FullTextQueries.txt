Full Text Queries?
The full text queries enable you to search analyzed text fields such as the body of an email. 
The query string is processed using the same analyzer that was applied to the field during indexing.

The queries in this group are:

intervals query: A full text query that allows fine-grained control of the ordering and proximity of matching terms.

match query: The standard query for performing full text queries, including fuzzy matching and phrase or proximity queries.

match_bool_prefix query:  Creates a bool query that matches each term as a term query, except for the last term, which is matched as a prefix query

match_phrase query: Like the match query but used for matching exact phrases or word proximity matches.

match_phrase_prefix query: Like the match_phrase query, but does a wildcard search on the final word.

multi_match query: The multi-field version of the match query.

combined_fields query: Matches over multiple fields as if they had been indexed into one combined field.

query_string query: Supports the compact Lucene query string syntax, allowing you to specify AND|OR|NOT conditions and 
multi-field search within a single query string. For expert users only.

simple_query_string query: A simpler, more robust version of the query_string syntax suitable for exposing directly to users.
